#MODULE 1 CODING ASSIGNMENT - implemented the following:

If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), a message should show up under to the textbox saying "Enjoy!".

If the number of items is greater than 3 (4, 5, and above), the message "Too much!"

If the textbox is empty and the user clicks the "Check If Too Much" button, the message "Please enter data first" should show up.
'Empty' here means either "" (empty string) or a string with just spaces in it.

Only 1 message should be shown at any given time.

#BONUS (OPTIONAL AND NOT GRADED) - implemented the following

If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the font color green.
If the message is "Please enter data first", make the font color red.

If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the border color around the textbox green.
If the message is "Please enter data first", make the border color around the textbox red.

**IMPLEMENTED THIS CASE!
Implement this case item 1, item2,,item3 or this case item 1, item2, ,item3 as not counting an 'empty' item towards the count of how many items there are in the list. Please make sure to put a comment somewhere next to the input textbox stating that you do NOT consider an empty item, i.e., , , as an item towards to the count, so whoever is grading your assignment doesn't erroneously mark that as an error.
